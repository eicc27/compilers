I am an Associate Professor in the School of Computer Science, Fudan University. My research interests include program analysis and software engineering, as well as their applications in AI systems, mobile computing, and cloud. I run a research group Artisan-Lab. Before joining Fudan University, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Chinese University of Hong Kong with CUHK Postdoctoral Research Fellowship. I also obtained my Ph.D. degree from CUHK, supervised by Prof. Michael Lyu. Before that, I have worked in industries as a system security professional after obtaining my M.Sc. degree from Hong Kong University, and B.Eng and B.M degrees from China University of Geosciences (Beijing)
